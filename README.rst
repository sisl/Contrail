Aircraft Encounter Modeling
******************

1 Overview
===============

Encounter modeling allows users to represent aircraft behavior using statistical models. These models 
describe how aircraft behave during close encounters and are used to provide a realistic set of encounter 
flight dynamics where an aircraft collision avoidance system would likely alert. While encounter models
represent encounter geometries, they also describe aircraft behavior during the entire course of
an encounter (speed, acceleration, etc.). 

Intended purpose of the EncounterGenerationGUI (EGGUI) is for users to generate, visualize and save large 
encounter data sets in order to develop and verify aircraft collision avoidance software.
