Usage
=====

The EncounterGenerationGUI (EGGUI) is designed to allow users to use aircraft encounter modeling
to generate large aircraft encounter data sets and interact with the generated data. In order to 
generate new encounters, the user must either upload a waypoint file with a preliminary set of 
aircraft encounters (.dat) or use EGGUI to create a nominal encounter with at least two aircrafts. 
The user will then select one encounter to represent the nominal encounter for the generation 
process.
