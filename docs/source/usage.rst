Contrail allows users to leverage aircraft encounter modeling
by specifying models from which to generate, visualize and save large aircraft encounter data sets. 

Primary Use Case: experts in the field applying knowledge of encounter flight dynamics to
generate realistic aircraft encounter data sets. These data sets can then be used to verify 
aircraft decision making software.

Secondary Use Case: any ethusiasts interested in generating aircraft encounter data sets for 
visualization and learning purposes!
