The EncounterGenerationGUI (EGGUI) is designed to allow users to leverage aircraft encounter modeling
to generate large aircraft encounter data sets and interact with the generated data. 

Primary Use Case: experts in the field applying knowledge on aircraft encounter dynamics to
generate realistic aircraft encounter data sets. These data sets can then be used for 
aircraft decision making software verification.

Secondary Use Case: any ethusiasts interested in generating aircraft encounter data sets for 
visualization and learning purposes!
