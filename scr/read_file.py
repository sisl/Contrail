# According to file format specified in Matlab script
# written by Mykel Kochenderfer, mykel@stanford.edu

# This script loads a "waypoints" file of the following format, and 
# returns a structure holding the waypoints for different encounter sets.

#     WAYPOINTS FILE:
#     The waypoints file contains a set of encounters. Each encounter is
#     defined by a set of waypoints associated with a fixed number of
#     aircraft. The waypoints are positions in space according to a fixed,
#     global coordinate system. All distances are in feet. Time is specified
#     in seconds since the beginning of the encounter. The file is organized
#     as follows:

#     [Header]
#     uint32 (number of encounters)
#     uint32 (number of aircraft)
#       [Encounter 1]
#           [Initial positions]
#               [Aircraft 1]
#               double (north position in feet)
#               double (east position in feet)
#               double (altitude in feet)
#               ...
#               [Aircraft n]
#               double (north position in feet)
#               double (east position in feet)
#               double (altitude in feet)
#           [Updates]
#               [Aircraft 1]
#               uint16 (number of updates)
#                   [Update 1]
#                   double (time in seconds)
#                   double (north position in feet)
#                   double (east position in feet)
#                   double (altitude in feet)
#                   ...
#                   [Update m]
#                   double (time in seconds)
#                   double (north position in feet)
#                   double (east position in feet)
#                   double (altitude in feet)
#               ...
#               [Aircraft n]
#                   ...
#       ...
#       [Encounter k]

#     WAYPOINTS STRUCTURE:
#     The waypoints structure is an m x n structure matrix, where m is the
#     number of aircraft and n is the number of encounters. This structure
#     matrix has two fields: initial and update. The initial field is a 3
#     element array specifying the north, east, and altitude. The update
#     field is a 4 x n matrix, where n is the number of updates. The rows
#     correspond to the time, north, east, and altitude position of the
#     waypoints.
